1. ### What is React?

    React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in application. This corresponds to view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

    
2. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.
